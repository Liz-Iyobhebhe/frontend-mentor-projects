## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt more about margins. border, padding, media queries, how to use the hover element, how to use SVG files.


### Continued development

I want to improve on my understanding of CSS, my ability to build a project by writing the code from scratch, know more on semantics in HTML. Techniques I found useful and would like to refine are media queries, styling with borders, margins and padding.
